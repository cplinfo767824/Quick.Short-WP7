<h1>Description</h1>

Don't you hate it when you want to share a link with your friend but the URL is too long and doesn't fit in your text message? We have found a simple solution to solve this annoying problem! All you do is provide us with your long URL and immediately after, we return with a very short 6 alphanumeric character extension URL. That way, you can easily share it with your friends! In addition, we have many great features to this application, such as: saving history and choosing services. (More awesome features to come!)
